      <p>Color is a powerful tool that allows for an almost infinite array of
        design options. Yet when applying color to our work, we can have a
        “myopic” viewpoint that puts us, rather than our audience, front and
        center. Author Geri Coady discusses some solid color considerations we
        can make for our audiences in this excerpt from her new book, Color
        Accessibility Workflows, available from A Book Apart.</p>
